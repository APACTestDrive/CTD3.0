#### Oracle Mobile Cloud Enterprise
Extending the scenarios in previous Cloud Test Drive, this session allows the user to extend the touch points to Chatbot and Microsites. Chatbot is one of the most popular channel with end user where Conversational AI to capture the customer needs via conversational approach. 
Oracle Mobile Cloud Enterprise (OMCe) is the platform to allow enterprise to build and deploy mobile apps and intelligent chatbots that connect to any backend system.
